# Single-Page Applications

# Summary

In this session, we will build off of the [Intro to Web Programming](https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-Web-Programming-beec0b0f708746abac3fc712ba033853) workshop, but take a slightly different path. We will explore the concept of "single-page web applications" by looking at the Vue.js framework. We will use Vue.js to build a simple portfolio site.

# Prerequisites

Please complete the following tasks before attending the workshop.

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    - If on macOS, I recommend using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager
        - Run the following command once `brew` is installed:
            - `brew install node`
    - Similarly to macOS, if you are on Linux, install Node through your package manager
2. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
    - TL;DR: run the following command in a terminal after Node is installed
        - `npm install -g yarn`
    - `yarn` is a package manager for Node.js projects and is a replacement for the built-in package manager, `npm`
3. [Install Vue CLI](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#cli)
    - TL;DR: run the following command in a terminal after Yarn is installed
        - `yarn global add @vue/cli`
